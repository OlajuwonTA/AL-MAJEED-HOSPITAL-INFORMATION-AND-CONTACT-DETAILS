          <h4>About Al-Majeed Hospital</h4>
          <p>
            <br />
            A beacon of hope and healing, built on a foundation of compassion,
            personal loss, and an unshakable commitment to quality healthcare
            for all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            <i>Founded by:</i>
            <b>Pharmacist Muslihudeen Tijani Adekilekun,</b> a UK-based
            pharmacist and philanthropist, the hospital was born out of a tragic
            but transformative event — the untimely death of our beloved
            brother, <b>Majeed Tijani Adekilekun.</b>Majeed lost his life due to
            the absence of competent and quality medical care when he needed it
            most. This heartbreaking loss ignited a passion in our to ensure
            that no one else in the community and beyond would have to suffer
            such a fate — not from lack of care, nor from inadequate facilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            Al-Majeed Hospital stands as a living tribute to Majeed’s memory — a
            place where every life matters, and every patient is treated with
            dignity, urgency, and expert care.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />
            Situated in a serene environment at Ede, Osun State, the hospital is
            led by <i>Dr. Musbau Olaniran</i>, our trusted Lead Medical Officer,
            and supported by a dedicated team of
            <i
              >skilled doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and healthcare
              professionals.</i
            >

            Together, we offer world-class medical care with a human touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br />

            approach — ensuring that no one is left behind in moments of medical
            need.<br />
